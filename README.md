### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer with an interest in C++, JS and Swift. 

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on:

- A VideoPlayer in SwiftUI that allows yout to directly access its underlying AVPlayerViewController object, and its delegate.
- An FFmpeg build script that builds it to a XCframework, and is continuously updated in line with new releases of FFmpeg, using Github Actions for CI.
- A Swift package for the above XCframework.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning UIKit and SwiftUI, as well as trying to get a working knowledge of bash scipting for my projects

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to collaborate on all my public projects so send me a PR.
